                <p>
                    When God appears to Abraham in Genesis 17 for him to be circumcised he had already been living in the covenant way of life from 75 years of age. God had already given him great and exceeding promises that were repeated over and over from Genesis 12 onwards. Thus, when God postulated that Abraham should be circumcised it had absolutely nothing to do with him receiving righteousness. Abraham’s belief in God’s promise is what counted as righteousness <sup>1</sup>.   
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Notwithstanding, it became important and imperative that God should grant Abraham a sign that would forever remind him of the fact that his righteousness was not of works and would never and should never be of works. The just are always to live by faith<sup>2</sup>. Such a sign would be akin to the ring that those married wear or a friendship bracelet. In the same way couples rekindle and remember each other’s vows when they see their rings and friends remember to be there for each other when they see the bracelets, so would it be with the covenant between God, Abraham and his descendants.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Therefore, the search for an appropriate mark became imperative. God in his infinite wisdom <sup>3</sup> decided that the mark should be as perpetual and permanent as God promises to Abraham. God could have chosen any other body part but He chose Abraham’s reproductive organ.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A mark on the skin would have mirrored the pagan traditions and such a mark loses legibility as one ages. What may have been a beautiful rose in one’s youth could easily become a bunch of vegetables in one’s latter years. On the other hand, the mark God chose is one that is perpetual- the removal of the foreskin is a permanent procedure that is irreversible. Furthermore, the mark was placed on children at 8 days old. At this point the child has done nothing to merit righteousness. The child has no good works to compel them before God. The child is simply male and a descendant of Abraham. Thus, the mark is placed on the child as an evidence of the unseen righteousness that the child will pursue and substance of morality that is hoped for in the child’s life<sup>4</sup>. Thus, the spirit of the command was upheld from the genesis of the child’s life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Moreover, such a mark embodied- at the start- God’s promise that He would make Abraham a great nation. It would be from his loins that a great nation would arise. Thus, in life of Isaac then to Jacob and then to Israel’s 12 sons down through all the generations the covenant was kept alive with the promise being brought to remembrance every time they beheld their reproductive organs.
                </p>

                <blockquote class="quote">
                    <p><span><i class="ri-double-quotes-l"></i></span> God could have placed the mark of righteousness by faith on any other part of Abraham's body but he decided to place it on his sexual organ. Thus, every time Abraham- and his male offspring- beheld their reproductive organs they remembered the God that sanctifies them. Even in periods of sexual temptation they could hold on to the promises of Him who does things for their good always. <span><i class="ri-double-quotes-r"></i></span></p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    Over time it must have come to symbolize God’s promises to make them fruitful<sup>5</sup>. Men are perpetually hormonally active thus it must have been such a wicked sense of humor for God to utilize this deeply ingrained desire to bring to remembrance His exceedingly great promises.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The sex drive is undeniably one of the greatest desires granted to humanity and one that has caused the greatest harm thus far. It also is the go-to sin when people drift from the living God. The Israelites when they made a golden calf ate drank and then fornicated<sup>6</sup>. That is why Paul advises that for sexual immorality the only wise cause is to flee<sup>7</sup>. This desire cannot be reasoned or debated with. Thus, God’s decision to place the mark of righteousness by faith on the male sex organ clearly shows that his thoughts that are as high as the heavens are above the earth<sup>8</sup>. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    To take an example of Joseph when he was under temptation by Potiphar’s wife. Potiphar’s wife must have been a mistress at the art of seduction and even though Joseph may have experienced temptation to fall for her devices<sup>9</sup>with a possibility of a stirring in his loins his own hormonal drive caused him to remember God’s commandment and promises concerning living a celibate life and went against his hormonal urges as he held on to the promises of He who does things for our good always<sup>10</sup> to declare “How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?” <sup>11</sup>.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    To look on the flipside the same train of thought surely holds. When a couple engaged in intercourse that keeps the marriage bed undefiled for the descendants of Abraham it reminded them of the God’s promises that He would deny them no good thing for they walked uprightly<sup>12</sup>. And that the same wisdom that founded the earth and established the heavens<sup>13</sup> surely ordained that a man shall leave father and mother and be joined to his wife and they shall be one flesh<sup>14</sup>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thus, God by setting up circumcision as a mark of righteousness by faith granted those of the House of Abraham a symbol by which to remember their vow to live a holy life and that God works in them to will and to do according to his good pleasure<sup>15</sup>. But it does not stop there. They are reminded of this multiple times in a day perpetually for the rest of their lives.
