                    John 3:16 is an extremely common verse that is known and easily recited by all Christians whether stounge or wishy-washy. Yet it carries within it an extremely potent Spiritual Growth that has seen opposition from modalism and tritheism. John records, ‘For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son’ – Christ is the begotten Son of God. Any attempt to postulate that he came to existence alongside God the Father makes him the unbegotten begotten Son of God and this view is unbiblical. Christ is thus God by inheritance.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    To beget is to bring in existence, simply put. At this point a question can be asked if the Father begot the Son then where is the mother? This question is nonsensical and can be put at rest by a simple analogy. During Christ’s incarnation when ‘the Word became flesh’<sup>1</sup>, a virgin gave birth to a child because the ‘power of the almighty overshadowed’<sup>2</sup> her. Is it then too hard a thing for the God of the Immaculate conception to beget a Son who became the ‘fulness of the Godhead bodily’?<sup>3</sup>. 
                </p>

                <blockquote class="quote">
                    <p><span><i class="ri-double-quotes-l"></i></span> Christ is the begotten Son of God.

                <p>
                    Moreover, the son is the ‘brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person’<sup>4</sup> thus when Christ said ‘”Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work. Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves,”’ <sup>5</sup> he spoke of the fact and reality that He and the Father are of one mind and are one in unity. That which the Father thinks is the same as that which the Son thinks. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Yet it is clear that in all this that even though the Father and the Son are all God for the Father says,
                </p>

              <p class="indent">
                ‘” Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands: They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment; And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail. “’ <sup>6</sup>
              </p>

              <p>
                there is a submission between the Father and the Son. This is to mean that it is the Father who speaks through the Son not the Son who speaks through the Father. It is the Son who sits at the Father’s right hand and not the Father who sits at the Son’s right hand. The Father and the Son are ‘echad’ – one in unity. 
              </p>

              <p>
                As further emphasis to Christ’s claim to be God’s Son hence his equal John further records that ‘And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.’ <sup>7</sup> Christ is the <em>only</em> begotten son hence ‘ being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they’ <sup>8</sup> and ‘again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.’ <sup>9</sup>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Therefore, Christ is not only God but also the Son of God and that is why ‘“I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End,” says the Lord(Jesus Christ), “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”’ <sup>10</sup>
              </p>
